In AT command operating environment, the modem has four functional states: 

The command state, 
The wait-for-carrier state, 
The on-line state, and 
The on-line command state. 

In the command state, the modem accepts AT commands form the terminal, allowing you to configure
the modem and dial telephone numbers. When the modem is powered on, it defaults to the command 
state. After modem dials a number, it enters a transition state, called the wait-for carrier 
state and waits for a carrier signal from the remote modem. If the modem does not detect a 
carrier signal within a preset time period (this period is defined by the value of S7 register), 
it abandons the call and re-enters the command state. You can also cause the modem to exit the 
wait-for-carrier state and return to the command state by pressing any key on the keyboard, 
causing a dial abort action. 
If modem detects a valid carrier signal, it connects with the remote modem, according to the 
best negotiation speed decided by both modems, and enters the on-line state. In this case, the 
modem transmits data asynchronously. If the carrier signal is lost or intentionally dropped the 
connection, the modem hangs up and re-enters the command state. 
While the modem is on line, you can temporarily exit the on-line state, and enter the on-line 
command state, from which limit set of AT commands can be entered to interrogate the modem 
current settings and make sure the connection is what is supposed to be and to disconnect the 
line gracefully. 
To enter the on-line command state, wait 1 second, type +++, wait another 1 second, and type 
AT, carriage return (this procedure is called Time Independent Escape Sequence, TIES). The 
first valid AT commands entered while the modem in the on-line command state will be executed 
just as they would be executed in the command state. If the first command is Invalid in this 
state, it will cause modem be to on-line state and you will have on-line connect message shown 
on the screen. 

After the first command is accepted and in the on-line command state, the rest AT commands 
will accepted with OK or rejected with ERROR and stay in this state until 
1. You issue ATO command to re-enter the on-line state, 
2. You issue ATH to drop the connection and back to command state, 
3. Connection is disconnected and the modem go back to command, 
4. Application program request modem to disconnect and go back to command state.
Configuration Profiles

A configuration profile refers to a complete set of operation parameters for the modem. The 
operating parameters in use at any one time are referred to as active profile. The active profile 
is stored in RAM in the modem and it may be viewed by entering AT&V. Each time the modem powers 
up, the active profile is loaded with profile 0 or 1 at the time modem was last powered off 

You can store the active profile into profile 0 or profile 1 and into the non-volatile memory 
(EEPROM) by entering AT&W0 or AT&W1. So next time the modem is powered up, you can assume the 
profile while you left off. 

The factory default profile, which is stored in ROM in the modem, consists of the operating 
parameters most commonly used for data communication and is satisfactory for the needs of most 
users. The default profile can be reload into active profile by entering AT&F. 
AT Command Syntax

With two exceptions, all AT commands are prefixed with AT (uppercase or lowercase, even, odd, none,
mark or space parity do not matter), which stands for "ATtention", command body, list in the 
following sections, and command line terminator, most commonly used is carriage return. 

The two exceptions are the "A/" command, which is used to repeat the last command, and the "+++" ,
which cause modem goes into on-line command state. 

There are 40 characters length limitation post on every single command line. Any command line 
exceed this limitation will results an ERROR result. 
AT Command set

PART I : Data Command Set

General Command 

A/ Repeat the last executed AT command 
Do not precede A/ with AT or follow with ENTER. 

AT Attention Characters 
'AT' character pairs always at the beginning of each command line, except 'A/', which is to repeat the last executed AT command. 

Note: The following commands always have to precede with 'AT' attention character pair, if it is the first command in the command line. 

A Manually answer incoming call 

D Dial (Originate a Call) 
The following modifiers can be used in the dial string: 
0-9,#,* Dialing digits. Touch Tone dial 
characters 
P Pulse dialing 
T Touch Tone dialing 
W Wait for second dial tone
